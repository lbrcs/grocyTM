### Stock

- The stock report "Spendings" now also supports grouping by stores
- Fixed that the upgrade failed when having (a lot of) redundant ("each to each") default quantity unit conversion definitions (thanks a lot @alkuzman and @esclear)
  - More on that by a practical example: When a conversion between Teaspoons and Milliliters and another one between Milliliters and Liters exists (and so forth; unlimited levels), Grocy can now (since v4.0.0) calculate the derived factor to convert Teaspoons to Liters on its own (before a direct conversion definition between Teaspoons and Liters was required)
  - So you might have a lot of such "each to each absolute conversion definitions" currently, when you were affected by failed upgrades (timeout problems due to that resolving indirect conversion factors took very long)
  - **Heads up:** This is now fixed, but you should clean up those redundant "each to each" definitions (in the example above the conversion between Teaspoons and Liters), since they are no longer needed
- Fixed that the "Mark this stock entry as open"-button on the stock entries page opened always one unit instead of the whole stock entry
- Fixed that edited stock entries were not considered in some cases (affecting the product's average price and the stock reports)

### Recipes

- Fixed that ingredient cost/energy values were wrong when unit conversions but _no_ product substitutions were involved
