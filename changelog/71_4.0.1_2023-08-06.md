> ðŸ’¡ PHP 8.2 is from now on (additionally to PHP 8.1) supported.

### Stock

- Fixed performance issues affecting all places where quantity unit conversions / prices are involved
- Fixed that the upgrade failed when having improperly defined product specific quantity unit conversions
- Fixed that edited stock entries were not considered in some cases (affecting the product's last price, average price, the price history and the stock reports)

### Shopping list

- Changed that unit prices on the shopping list (table column "Last price (Unit)") are now related to the there selected quantity unit (instead of to the product's QU stock as before)

### Meal plan

- Fixed that the meal plan did initially not display the current week when the settings `MEAL_PLAN_FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK` and `CALENDAR_FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK` were set to different values

### API

- Fixed performance issues on the endpoint `/stock/products/{productId}`
