- Fixed that the "Add all list items to stock" shopping list workflow did not work for more than ~6 items (thanks @tjhowse)
- Fixed that plural form handling (e.g. for quantity units) was wrong for negative numbers
- Fixed that the context menu entries `Consume` and `Transfer` on the stock overview page were disabled when the amount in stock was < 1
- Fixed that on consuming a product from not the products default location, the products default location was recorded in the stock journal
- Fixed that when undoing a stock consume transaction from not the products default location, the corresponding amount was always added back to to the products defaullt location
- Fixed that when having multiple quantity unit conversions for a products default QU purchase, on purchase was potentially a wrong conversion factor picked
- Fixed that when there was any chore with a schedule, but without a "next estimated tracking" date/time, the iCal export was broken
- The product and chore edit pages now have bottom-sticky save buttons
- A product picture can now be added when creating a product (was currently only possible when editing a product)

### API
- Fixed that international characters and spaces were not allowed in API query filters
